this is a test from my new laptop.  


recent changing:
1. added scale factor to HDREnv to control the brightness;
2. added progress bar to indicate the rendering process, previously it was only a percentage number, not it has both;
3. added gamma correction function to ImageProc to handle the gamma correction in the postpone image processing phase.
